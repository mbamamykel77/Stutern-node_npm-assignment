What is the Event loop

The event loop is a single-threaded loop that watches the call stack and checks if there's any code to run in the task queue. If the call stack is empty and there're callback functions in the task queue, then they'll be dequeued from the task queue and run by pushing them to the call stack.

Explain the 6 phases of the event loop

Timers: In this phase, any setTimeout() or setInterval() functions that have elapsed are processed. The callbacks associated with these timers are added to the callback queue, ready for execution in the next phase.

Pending callbacks: This phase executes any I/O callbacks that are ready to be processed. For example, if there are any incoming network requests that have completed, their corresponding callback functions will be executed at this point.

Idle, prepare: This phase is used to prepare the system for the next cycle of the event loop. This could include tasks such as polling for new events or updating the user interface.

Poll: This phase retrieves new I/O events and executes their associated callback functions. If there are no I/O events to process, this phase will wait until new events arrive.

Check: In this phase, any setImmediate() functions that have been registered are processed. These functions are executed immediately after the current cycle of the event loop has completed.

Close callbacks: The final phase is used to execute any close event callbacks. This phase is triggered when a socket or file is closed, and any associated cleanup code can be executed at this point.

List some best practices in server-side code development

Code quality: Maintain high code quality standards by using best practices such as modularization, code reuse, and following clean code principles. This makes your code easier to maintain and reduces the risk of bugs.

Performance: Server-side code should be optimized for performance. This includes minimizing response times, reducing database queries, and optimizing algorithms and data structures.

Documentation: Document your code to make it easier for other developers to understand and work with it. Include comments, API documentation, and usage examples.

Logging and monitoring: Use logging and monitoring tools to track the performance of your code and detect issues early. This includes using tools like loggers, performance monitoring software, and application monitoring software.

Scalability: Design your code to be scalable, so that it can handle increased traffic and workload. This includes using load balancing, caching, and horizontal scaling techniques.

What is NPM5: How do you initialize a package in npm

NPM5 is a version of the Node Package Manager, a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is used to manage and share packages of code that can be installed and used in Node.js applications.

Open your command-line interface and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

Run the command npm init. This will start the initialization process and prompt you for various pieces of information about your project, such as the project name, version, description, author, and license.

Follow the prompts to fill in the necessary information. If you're not sure what to enter for a particular field, you can usually leave it blank or use the default value.

Once you've entered all the necessary information, NPM will generate a package.json file in your project directory. This file contains information about your project and the packages it depends on.

You can then use NPM to install packages and dependencies for your project. For example, if you want to install the popular Express framework, you can run the command npm install express in your project directory.

How do you run a script in the package.json ?

Open your terminal or command-line interface and navigate to the directory where your project's package.json file is located.

Locate the "scripts" field in the package.json file. This field is an object that contains a list of script names and their corresponding commands.

Find the name of the script you want to run and copy it.

In your terminal, type npm run followed by the script name. For example, if you want to run a script named start, you can type npm run start.

Press enter to execute the script. NPM will look up the script name in the package.json file and run the corresponding command.
